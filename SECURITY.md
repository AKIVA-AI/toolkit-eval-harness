# Security

## Supported versions

This tool is currently in early-stage development. Security fixes are best-effort.

## Reporting

If you discover a security issue, do not open a public issue. Contact the maintainers privately.

## Guidance

- Treat suites, predictions, and model outputs as untrusted input.
- Run in a sandboxed CI environment when evaluating untrusted content.
